## 🧪 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Logistic Regression

Each model is trained and evaluated to select the best-performing one for deployment in the web interface.

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. User inputs student details (grades, attendance, etc.)
2. The system preprocesses data and applies a trained ML model
3. Predicted performance is shown (e.g., Pass/Fail, Grade level)

## 📊 Result Analysis

The project evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict student performance using a dataset of academic and behavioral attributes. The performance of each model was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Below is a summary of the findings:

| Model                        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Decision Tree                | 84%      | 0.83      | 0.85   | 0.84     |
| Random Forest                | *88%*  | 0.87      | 0.88   | 0.87     |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 82%      | 0.81      | 0.83   | 0.82     |
| Logistic Regression          | 80%      | 0.79      | 0.80   | 0.79     |

## 🧠 Key Observations:

* *Random Forest* performed the best overall, offering the highest accuracy and balanced F1-score.
* *Decision Tree* was slightly less accurate but easier to interpret and visualize.
* *SVM* showed good generalization but took longer to train on larger datasets.
* *Logistic Regression* gave the lowest performance, possibly due to limited linear relationships in the dataset.

## 📌 Insights:

* Attributes like *attendance, **previous grades, and **internal test scores* had the highest influence on predictions.
* Students with low internal scores but high attendance were often misclassified, showing a need for broader feature sets.
* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categories) had a significant impact on model performance.
